    <p>"It was such a relief to see him hit so clearly. Simply outstanding hitting. It was Russell muscle, for serious," declared Kolkata Knight Riders captain Shreyas Iyer at the post-match press conference.</p>

    <p class="para2">"I was just having a chat with him. He said he's getting older but I told him he's getting fitter and stronger. He's been putting in the hard yards at practice. I see him in the gym every time I go. He's hungry and wants the team to win. He's been a great colleague to work with," added Iyer.</p>

    <p>Punjab Kings were dismissed for a modest 137 in 18.2 overs, Umesh Yadav bagging four wickets for 23 runs. That effort won the pacer the 'Player of the Match' award.</p>
